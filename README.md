# Penda

Check out a short demo of Penda: https://youtu.be/0SbUMeBXZr4  

Penda is a sample web app that gives businesses and clients the ability to come together for the sake of transparency in time tracking and billable hours, whether that's through freelance work, contract work, or otherwise. Additionally, users can use Penda in a non-professional capacity as a great time tracker and project management application. 

This project was done as a learning experience for Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and the Rails asset pipeline.
