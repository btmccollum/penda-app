# Penda

Penda is a sample web app that gives businesses and clients the ability to come together for the sake of transparency in time tracking and billable hours, whether that's through freelance work, contract work, or otherwise. Additionally, users can use Penda in a non-professional capacity as a great time tracker and project management application. 

## Getting Started

To get started, fork and close this repo.

Run 'thin start --ssl' in your terminal to launch a local server and navigate to it (https://localhost:3000) - have fun!

### Motivation

This project largely exists to challenge and demonstrate my knowledge with the standard Rails framework. In the future additional features will be added, and undergo a larger overhaul with JavaScript worked in.
